                    <p>
                        A long long time ago<br>
                        There was a volcano<br>
                        Living all alone in the middle of the sea<br>
                    </p> 
                    <p>      
                        He sat high above his bay<br>
                        Watching all the couples play<br>
                        And wishing that he had someone too<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And from his lava came<br>
                        This song of hope that he sang out loud<br>
                        Every day<br>
                        For years and years<br>
                        I have a dream<br>
                        I hope it will come true<br>
                        That you're here with me<br>
                        And I am here with you<br>
                        I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above<br>
                        Will send me someone to lava<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Years of singing all alone<br>
                        Turned his lava into stone<br>
                        Until he was on the brink of extinction<br>
                        But little did he know<br>
                        That living in the sea below<br>
                        Another volcano<br>
                        Was listening to his song<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everyday she heard his tune<br>
                        Her lava grew and grew<br>
                        Because she believed his song was meant for her<br>
                        Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea<br>
                    </p>
